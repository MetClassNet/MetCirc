\title{Calculate the normalised dot product}
\usage{
NDP(matrow1, matrow2, m = 0.5, n = 2, mass)
}
\arguments{
\item{matrow1}{\code{character} or \code{numeric} vector, the entries 
correspond to the mass vector and contain corresponding intensities to the 
masses, it is the first feature to compare}

\item{matrow2}{\code{character} or \code{numeric} vector, the entries 
correspond to the mass vector and contain corresponding intensities to the 
masses, it is the second feature to compare}

\item{m}{\code{numeric}, exponent to calculate peak intensity-based weights}

\item{n}{\code{numeric}, exponent to calculate peak intensity-based weights}

\item{mass}{\code{character} or \code{numeric} vector, vector with all masses 
which occur in the data set}
}
\value{
NDP returns a numeric similarity coefficient between 0 and 1
}
\description{
Calculate the normalised dot product (NDP)
}
\details{
The NDP is calculated according to the following formula: 
 \deqn{NDP = \frac{\sum(W_{S1, i} \cdot W_{S2, i}) ^ 2}{ \sum(W_{S1, i} ^ 2) * \sum(W_{S2, i} ^ 2) }}{\sum(W_{S1, i} \cdot W_{S2, i}) ^ 2 \sum(W_{S1, i} ^ 2) * \sum(W_{S2, i} ^ 2)},
 with \eqn{W = [ peak intensity] ^{m} \cdot [m/z]^n}. For further information 
 see Li et al. (2015): Navigating natural variation in herbivory-induced
 secondary metabolism in coyote tobacco populations using MS/MS structural analysis. 
 PNAS, E4147--E4155. NDP returns a numeric value ranging between 0 and 1, where 0 
indicates no similarity between the two MS/MS features, while 1 indicates 
that the MS/MS features are identical.
