Convert msp data frame into MSP format
}
\details{
msp is a data frame of a .MSP file, a typical data file for 
MS/MS libraries. The data frame has two columns and contains in the first
column the entries "NAME:", 
"PRECURSORMZ:" (or "EXACTMASS:"), "Num Peaks:"  and information on fragments and 
peak areas/intensities. It may additionally contain row entries:
\code{convertMSP2MSP} will try to find the row entries "RETENTIONTIME:",
"ADDUCTIONNAME:" (or "PRECURSORTYPE:"), "CLASS:" and "INFORMATION:" and 
extract the respective information in the second column.
